wordpress-adopt-a-codex-badge
=============================

Demo: http://make.rami.nu/ (In the sidebar)

Display a simple widget in your sidebar to show your involvement in the WordPress Codex.

A very simple widget that displays a badge in any widgetized area, links to your Codex user page, and your feed of recent
Codex activity.

============================

Get involved with the WordPress Codex here: http://make.wordpress.org/docs
The WordPress Codex: http://codex.wordpress.org

=============================
Further ideas:

*Options to use different badge(s).

*Option to disable feed

*Disable WPINC/.feed.php include_once on admin screens, possibly use alternate feed method

*Incorporating the Username into the image might be a good idea.

*Some UI enhancement, if desired. Pretty simple right now with just the image and feed.
