wordpress-adopt-a-codex-badge
=============================

Demo: http://make.rami.nu/ (In the sidebar)

Display a simple widget in your sidebar to show your involvement in the WordPress Codex.

A very simple widget that displays a badge in any widgetized area, and links to your Codex user page.
That's about it for the moment.

You can get involved with the WordPress Codex here: make.wordpress.org/docs
The WordPress Codex: http://codex.wordpress.org

=============================
Further ideas:
Maybe an RSS feed of latest contributions would be a good idea.
Options to use different badges.
Making the entire widget without using an image would be pretty sweet. Use Genericons or something for the WP logo?
